Firstly, create the Blynk interface comprising an LED and a SLIDER, assigning the virtual pins accordingly, as shown in the Arduino code.

1.The device reads real-time current values from the sensor and updates them on Blynk.
2.The Blynk interface offers a slider to set the limit for the current usage by the load.
3.Ready to go!
